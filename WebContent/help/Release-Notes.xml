				<line>Each group of students can be restricted to particular course types (provided using a regular expression, e.g., !No Pre-Reg),
					course names (provided using a regular expression, e.g, .*[0-9]OL for all courses with OL suffix),
					or instructional methods (provided using a regular expression, e.g., PO|PH for course configurations with PO or PH instructional methods).
					<line>A course name or instructional method regular expression can be negated by using an exclamation mark as a prefix (e.g., !.*[0-9]OL for all courses without an OL suffix).</line>
					<line>If multiple expressions are provided (e.g., both course and instructional method), depending on the mode of the rule, all of the expressions must match or just one.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Each rule can be restricted by a regular expression matching academic initiative, a regular expression matching term, start and end year.</line>
				<line>The rules are processed in the given order.</line>
